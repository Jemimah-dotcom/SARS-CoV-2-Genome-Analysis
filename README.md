# SARS-CoV-2 Genome Sequence Analysis

Comparative genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 reference genome and variant strains using Python and bioinformatics tools.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences to identify mutations, calculate nucleotide composition, and perform sequence alignments between reference and variant strains.

## 🔬 Analysis Performed

- **Sequence Loading**: Reference genome and 2 variant strains
- **Nucleotide Counting**: Base composition (A, T, G, C) for each sequence
- **GC Content Calculation**: Genomic G+C percentage
- **Pairwise Alignment**: Sequence comparison between strains
- **Multiple Sequence Alignment**: Global alignment using Clustal Omega
- **Mutation Analysis**: Identification of base changes across strains

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Biopython** - Sequence manipulation and analysis
- **Clustal Omega** - Multiple sequence alignment

## 🚀 Key Skills Demonstrated

✓ Sequence data handling  
✓ Comparative genomics  
✓ Bioinformatics algorithms  
✓ Mutation detection
